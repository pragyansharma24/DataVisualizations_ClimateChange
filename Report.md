# PART 1: Analysis of data visualization graphs 

## Data Visualization Evaluation Framework
The data visualization effectiveness profile which is used here for the evaluation of five data visualizations selected for the project titled “Climate Change Caused by Human Activity” is shown in Figure 1. This effectiveness profile is based on the evaluation framework designed by Few (2017) who proposed seven distinct criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of data visualizations. Figure 1 shows
these criteria along with a qualitative scoring method designed for each criterion. These seven criteria are broadly categorized into two categories: (1) Informative and (2) Emotive. While the first five criteria, namely, Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness and Intuitiveness lie in the first category and address the degree to which a visualization is informative, the second category includes two criteria, namely, Aesthetics and Engagement that measures useful emotional responses produced by a
visualization (Few, 2017).

Few (2017) also provided guidelines to graphically represent how well a visualization is designed. Although the graphical representation in Few (2017) omitted a quantitative scale for data visualization effectiveness profile, other works from literature related to evaluation frameworks (e.g. Atwood and Reznik-Zellen, 2018) have included a quantitative scale for scoring within each criterion (e.g. 0 to 5-point scale). I believe that for the type of visualizations selected here, it is more meaningful to evaluate them using a quantitate scale within each criterion. Therefore, for the current project, I have used the effectiveness profile suggested by Few (2017) together with a quantitative 0 to 5-point scale for each criterion. For example, for “Usefulness” criterion a score of zero (0) would imply “Useless visualization” and a score of five (5) would suggest a “very useful visualization”.

A summary of guidelines for these seven criteria is provided below. More details can be found in Few (2017) and other sources (Vidya, 2016; Interactive Design Foundation, 2019; Tufte, 20XX).

1. **Usefulness**: Visualizations must be designed to have useful end goals and insights. According to Few (2017), this criterion can only be determined considering the audience’s needs. A data visualization should provide information that is useful. If it isn’t useful, it isn’t important. 

2. **Completeness** – Per Few (2017), completeness simply is a measure of information that is needed to produce the intended level of understanding, but not more. In addition, elements of a visualization figure (e.g. labels, axes, tick marks, legends, source, choice of colors) should be appropriately defined. A context is always required to better understand a visualization. Few (2017) further explains, “Context is usually provided in the form of comparisons, such as comparisons to targets, measures of the norm, and historical values.”

3. **Perceptibility**: As mentioned in Few (2017), “The information must be displayed in a manner that the human eye and brain can perceive with minimal effort and appropriate precision. This involves selecting the type of graph that displays the information most effectively and designing it in a way that presents the information as clearly as possible.” Forcing people to compare the sizes or color intensities of objects reduces perceptibility. Also, as explained in Vidya (2016), our eyes are drawn to familiar patterns and we see what we expect to see. Our working memory is very limited, and we can hold a very limited amount of information in our memory when looking at a visual. Hence visualization must take into account what people know and expect.

4. **Truthfulness** – Per Few (2017), data visualizations should exhibit both attributes of accuracy and validity to the fullest. For example, “If a bar in a bar graph that is twice the height of another represents anything other than twice the value, it is inaccurate. If a graph presents a country’s median household income as a measure of its people’s happiness, it is invalid.” I believe that “visual
integrity” term used by Tufte (xxxx) can also be correlated to “Truthfulness”. As explained by Interactive Design Foundation (2019), data representation should neither distort the underlying data nor create a false impression or interpretation of that data. This implies that numerical scales should be properly proportionate and should not be altered to exagerate a particular result. Moreover, the
dimensions used within an image should be limited to the dimensions within the data and should never exceed them and finally that the keys (or legends) should be undistorted and unambiguous.

5. **Intuitiveness**: As precisely stated in Few (2017), “A data visualization is intuitive to the degree that it is familiar and easily understood. There are times when an unfamiliar form of display is preferable because it communicates the intended message more clearly than any familiar form of display could do. In these cases, the unfamiliar form of display should not be more difficult than necessary to understand and should be accompanied by simple instructions that enable its use with relatively little learning.” Per Tufte’s design principles, sometimes use of borders, background, 3-D effects, etc. may do nothing but serve to distract the user from the information. In addition, one should always perceive that how the audience one caters to read and perceive data. A visualization that is intuitive to someone from the scientific community may not be intuitive at all for common public.

6. **Aesthetics**: Per Few (2017), “The aesthetic quality of a data visualization can range from ugly (a display that no one would choose to view for long) to beautiful (one that would invite even those who care little for the information to take perhaps delight in learning about it).” In addition, as mentioned by Interactive Design Foundation (2019), Tufte’s interpretation of aesthetic elegance of a visualization is not based on the “physical beauty” of an information visualization but rather the “simplicity of the design” evoking the complexity of the data clearly.

7. **Engagement**: By engagement, Few (2017) means a quality that can be achieved by various means. It invites the audience and draws them into data to examine the information and does not distract audience from data.
