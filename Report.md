# PART 1: Analysis of Data Visualization Graphs 

## Data Visualization Evaluation Framework
The data visualization effectiveness profile which is used here for the evaluation of five data visualizations selected for the project shown in Figure 1. This effectiveness profile is based on the evaluation framework designed by Few (2017) who proposed seven distinct criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of data visualizations. Figure 1 shows these criteria along with a qualitative scoring method designed for each criterion. These seven criteria are broadly categorized into two categories: (1) Informative and (2) Emotive. While the first five criteria, namely, Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness and Intuitiveness lie in the first category and address the degree to which a visualization is informative, the second category includes two criteria, namely, Aesthetics and Engagement that measures useful emotional responses produced by a visualization (Few, 2017).

Few (2017) also provided guidelines to graphically represent how well a visualization is designed. Although the graphical representation in Few (2017) omitted a quantitative scale for data visualization effectiveness profile, other works from literature related to evaluation frameworks (e.g. Atwood and Reznik-Zellen, 2018) have included a quantitative scale for scoring within each criterion (e.g. 0 to 5-point scale). I believe that for the type of visualizations selected here, it is more meaningful to evaluate them using a quantitative scale within each criterion. Therefore, for the current project, I have used the effectiveness profile suggested by Few (2017) together with a quantitative 0 to 5-point scale for each criterion. For example, for “Usefulness” criterion a score of zero (0) would imply “Useless visualization” and a score of five (5) would suggest a “very useful visualization”.

  <b>Figure 1: Evaluation Framework per Few (2017)</b>
<p>

A summary of guidelines for these seven criteria is provided below. More details can be found in Few (2017) and other sources (Vidya, 2016 and Interactive Design Foundation, 2019).

1. **Usefulness**: Visualizations must be designed to have useful end goals and insights. According to Few (2017), this criterion can only be determined considering the audiences' needs. A data visualization should provide information that is useful. If it isn’t useful, it isn’t important. 

2. **Completeness**: Per Few (2017), Completeness simply is a measure of information that is needed to produce the intended level of understanding, but not more. In addition, elements of a visualization figure (e.g. labels, axes, tick marks, legends, source, choice of colors) should be appropriate. A context is always required to better understand a visualization. Few (2017) further explains, “Context is usually provided in the form of comparisons, such as comparisons to targets, measures of the norm, and historical values.”

3. **Perceptibility**: As mentioned in Few (2017), “The information must be displayed in a manner that the human eye and brain can perceive with minimal effort and appropriate precision. This involves selecting the type of graph that displays the information most effectively and designing it in a way that presents the information as clearly as possible.” Forcing people to compare the sizes or color intensities of objects reduces perceptibility. Also, as explained in Vidya (2016), our eyes are drawn to familiar patterns and we see what we expect to see. Our working memory is very limited, and we can hold a very limited amount of information in our memory when looking at a visual. Hence visualization must take into account what people know and expect.

4. **Truthfulness** – Per Few (2017), data visualizations should exhibit both attributes of accuracy and validity to the fullest. For example, “If a bar in a bar graph that is twice the height of another represents anything other than twice the value, it is inaccurate. If a graph presents a country’s median household income as a measure of its people’s happiness, it is invalid.” I believe that “visual
integrity” term used by Tufte's design principles can also be correlated with “Truthfulness”. As explained by Interactive Design Foundation (2019), data representation should neither distort the underlying data nor create a false impression or interpretation of that data. This implies that numerical scales should be properly proportionate and should not be altered to exaggerate a particular result. Moreover, the dimensions used within an image should be limited to the dimensions within the data and should never exceed them and finally that the keys (or legends) should not be distorted or ambiguous.

5. **Intuitiveness**: As precisely stated in Few (2017), “A data visualization is intuitive to the degree that it is familiar and easily understood. There are times when an unfamiliar form of display is preferable because it communicates the intended message more clearly than any familiar form of display could do. In these cases, the unfamiliar form of display should not be more difficult than necessary to understand and should be accompanied by simple instructions that enable its use with relatively little learning.” Per Tufte’s design principles, sometimes use of borders, background, 3-D effects, etc. may do nothing but serve to distract the user from the information. In addition, one should always understand how the audience read and perceive data. A visualization that is intuitive to someone from the scientific community may not be intuitive at all for the common public.

6. **Aesthetics**: Per Few (2017), “The aesthetic quality of a data visualization can range from ugly (a display that no one would choose to view for long) to beautiful (one that would invite even those who care little for the information to take perhaps delight in learning about it).” In addition, as mentioned by Interactive Design Foundation (2019), Tufte’s interpretation of aesthetic elegance of a visualization is not based on the “physical beauty” of an information visualization but rather the “simplicity of the design” evoking the complexity of the data clearly.

7. **Engagement**: By engagement, Few (2017) means a quality that can be achieved by various means. It invites the audience and draws them into data to examine the information and does not distract audience from data.


## Data Visualizations and their Evaluation using Framework

### Visualization 1
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/Viz1_RadiativeForces.JPG" alt="Radiative Forces text" width="600">
</p>

**Source**: This visualization is taken from a research article (Forster et. al, 2001) titled “Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing”. [link](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter2-1.pdf)

**Evaluation Score**: My assessment score for Visualization #1 is given below: 

**Criterion**| **Score**
---------- | :---: 
Usefulness |5
Completeness|5 
Perceptibility|3
Truthfulness|5 
Intuitiveness|4
Aesthetics|5
Engagement|5

**Evaluation Summary**: With regards to the impact of human activities and natural factors on climate change, this visualization provides plenty of useful information and insights to the readers. This visualization is important and useful for the authors to clearly describe their hypothesis in the research article. The visualization shows completeness in the sense that it provides just enough information, not more or less (data-ink ratio of 1). It uses axes labels, tick marks, and text in the figure properly. Choice of colors is also reasonable as it depicts the factors negatively affecting the climate in red and factors positively affecting the climate in blue. 

This visualization gets a score of 3 out of 5 for Perceptibility because it requires some effort to interpret, especially the last row in the plot that shows the sum of all human activities. Authors could have provided more clarity in illustrating that the last two rows are there to be compared and provide a summary of their results. Moreover, Bar Plots, in general, are intuitive and easily understood, however, this visualization earns a slightly low score (4 out of 5) for Intuitiveness because it does take some time, when first encountered, to figure out how to read it. There is no doubt that this scientific visualization scores highly in Truthfulness as it reflects both accuracy and validity in the presentation of data. There is no visual evidence of lack of visual integrity. Its simplicity of design makes it easy to interpret and aesthetically elegant. It draws my attention and engages me into it to investigate the information provided.

### Visualization 2

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/Viz2_SeaLevel.gif" alt="Sea Level" width="600">
</p>

**Source**: This visualization animation is taken from article Climate Viz. [link](http://www.pierdr.com/filter/Data-visualization/climate-viz).

**Evaluation Score**: My assessment score for Visualization #2 is given below: 

**Criterion**| **Score**
---------- | :---: 
Usefulness | 5
Completeness| 3 
Perceptibility| 5
Truthfulness|4
Intuitiveness|4
Aesthetics|5
Engagement|5

**Evaluation Summary**: This visualization does a commendable job in illustrating Sea Level Rise (SLR) Anomalies in the coastal USA as a result of climate change. Author Pietro de la Rosa’s main idea for creating this visualization was to spread awareness about the state of climate change. This visual clearly provides useful and important information that can be used to increase awareness among people from all sectors of society. Despite being a useful visualization, it lacks completeness in a sense that it could have provided more information in terms of actual SLR numbers. Also, the data-ink ratio for this visual is very low. 

The visualization gets a score of 5 out of 5 for Perceptibility because it hardly requires any effort for perceiving the powerful message behind it. Choice of colors is reasonable as it presents increasing sea level, which has negative impacts, in red and decreasing sea levels, which are not as alarming, in blue. This visualization also gets a slightly low score (4 out of 5) for Intuitiveness because it is not a familiar form of plot for most people. Without enough information provided by the author in the form of labels and numbers on SLR, it is difficult to judge the accuracy and validity (Truthfulness) of this visual, hence a score of 4 out of 5. There is no visual evidence for the lack of visual integrity. 

In terms of Aesthetics and Engagement, this visualization gets a full score. Animations, in general, engage users, and its simplicity of design while delivering a powerful message makes this animation aesthetically elegant.  


### Visualization 3

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/Viz3_TempChanges.gif" alt="Temperature Changes" width="600">
</p>

**Source**: This visualization is taken from the Flickr account of Antti Lipponen, a research scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. [link](https://www.flickr.com/photos/150411108@N06/)

**Evaluation Score**: My assessment score for Visualization #3 is given below:

**Criterion**| **Score**
---------- | :---: 
Usefulness | 5
Completeness| 5 
Perceptibility| 4
Truthfulness|5 
Intuitiveness|4
Aesthetics|4
Engagement|5

**Evaluation Summary**: Antti Lipponen has put together an incredibly powerful data visualization showing climate change in each country over time starting from 1880. Date used for this animation were taken from surface temperature analysis performed by NASA. There is no doubt regarding how important and useful information this visualization provides with regards to climate change, so a score of 5 out of 5 on “Usefulness” criterion. Visualization also shows completeness as it provides just enough information, not more or less, to deliver what it intends to. It also includes a color ramp on top with varying size of circles for aid to comprehension and for accuracy. Choice of colors is also reasonable as the red and blue circles show temperature rise and drop, respectively relative to 1880. 

This temperature anomaly animation visual is optimal in most respects except for a lower score in intuitiveness, because it does take some time, when first encountered, to figure out how to read it. It is not a common type of visual which makes it little harder to interpret at first so a score of 4 out of 5 for Intuitiveness. Also, in regards with Perceptibility, it makes my brain and eyes to do some work before I can make sense of everything that this animation delivers. However, I also believe there is no significantly better way to incorporate this amount of information in a visualization, so I haven’t lowered the perceptibility score below 4.

Aesthetically, it is relatively less pleasing to the eye, in part because the names of the countries at some places (e.g. Ukraine, United Arab Amirates, etc. in the bottom row) create a cluttered appearance. And finally, there is a lot about this animation that invites the viewer to examine the data. There is something for every viewer in this animation to explore. 


### Visualization 4

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/Viz4_Perception.png" alt="Perception" width="600">
</p>

**Source**: This visualization is taken from a technical report (Connie et al., 2014). [link](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Six-Americas-October-2014.pdf)

**Evaluation Score**: My assessment score for Visualization #4 is given below:

**Criterion**| **Score**
---------- | :---: 
Usefulness | 5
Completeness| 5 
Perceptibility| 3
Truthfulness|2 
Intuitiveness|3
Aesthetics|5
Engagement|5

**Evaluation Summary**: This visualization is useful and important because it displays public's understanding of the causes of global warming and how much they are concerned about climate change. This visualization uses a stacked percentage chart and is complete in all aspects as it is able to produce the intended level of understanding with proper use of figure elements. However, as far as Perceptibility is concerned, it gets a low score of 3 out of 5. It is not clear whether the numbers on the bars (in white) are the number of people who took the survey or some sort of percentages. Moreover, because of the 0-100% scaling used on Y-axis, it is difficult to visually compare two categories (e.g. Alarmed vs Disengaged). Also, probably due to the rounding off errors, the percentages are not adding to 100% (e.g. the numbers in category “Doubtful” are adding to 101%). Stacked bar charts are simple and intuitive in general, and therefore this visualization gets a score of 5 for Intuitiveness.

This graph gets a very low score (2 out of 5) for Truthfulness because 42% of “Cautious” is not equivalent to 43% of “Dismissive” as it is perceived from the visualization, and hence it gives an incorrect impression.  I consider it as a visual distortion of data. As for aesthetics, it is evoking the complexity of the data with simple design, so it is aesthetically elegant. It is also engaging viewers to investigate information provided in terms of data and does not distract them. 

### Visualization 5

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/Viz5_Against.png" alt="Against Global Warming" width="600">
</p>

**Source**: This data visualization is taken from the following link which appears to be created by Roy Spencer, PhD, Former NASA Scientist, Climatologist, and a climate change denialist. [link](http://www.drroyspencer.com/2013/07/senate-epw-hearing-climate-change-its-happened-before/)

**Evaluation Score**: My assessment score for Visualization #5 is given below:

**Criterion**| **Score**
---------- | :---: 
Usefulness | 5
Completeness| 5 
Perceptibility| 4
Truthfulness|5 
Intuitiveness|3
Aesthetics|5
Engagement|5

**Evaluation Summary**: Spencer (2013) writes, “this chart illustrates that, yes, we are currently warm, but not significantly warmer than the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) or the Roman Warm Period (RWP). So how is it we know today’s warmth is human-caused when the last two warm periods couldn’t have been caused by humans? Hmmm?” This is definitely a very useful and important visualization as, contrary to other four visualizations evaluated above, it denies the claim that climate change is caused by human activities. Note that the original source of this visualization is Ljungquist (2010) but Spencer (2013) has added more labels to it for providing better understandability.

Apart from being a useful visualization, it also shows “Completeness” in a sense that it tends to produce an intended level of understanding, I believe the data-ink ratio is close to 1, and all figure elements are appropriately placed. 

This visualization hardly requires any effort for perceiving the powerful message behind it. Use of labels for indicating different periods (Medieval, Roman, etc.) makes it even more easily perceivable. The colors of the labels for warmer and cooler periods are shown in red and blue, respectively which is also reasonable.  However, the “Satelite” label in blue color does not relate to temperature data so a score of 4 out of 5 for Perceptibility. This visualization gets a score of 5 out of 5 for Intuitiveness because line chart is a very familiar form of a chart for most viewers. There is no visual evidence of lack of visual integrity. There is literature that disputes the claim made by Spencer (2013) during Senate hearing in 2013 but that is not used to judge the “visual integrity” or “accuracy” of the visualization.  

In terms of Aesthetics and Engagement, this visualization gets a full score. Due to its ability to evoke the complexity of the data clearly with a simple design, it is rated aesthetically elegant.  It also has a reasonable appeal that draws users into it, rather than distracting them. 


## Overall Assessment and Conclusion: 
Evaluation frameworks with a consistent set of criteria provide a robust tool to assess the effectiveness of visualizations and to discuss their relative merits with others using a common language (Few, 2017). For the self-study project, I have first identified a literature-based evaluation framework that provides seven distinct criteria for assessing the effectiveness of a data visualization. Using a 0 to 5-point scale for each of the seven criteria, I have critiqued five distinct visualizations related to “Climate Change caused by Human Activity”. While four of these visualizations support the claim that climate change is caused by human activities, one visualization supports the hypothesis that climate change is a natural process and humans have no role to play in changing the climate.

I found the framework very effective in assessing the visualizations. Using the framework, each visualization was scored for seven criteria. Following the guidelines provided in the literature, I found it easy to score the visualizations. For the present study, it is assumed that all criteria have equal weightage. If one must predict a single score per visualization, an approach that assigns appropriate weightage to each criterion much be considered. All these visualizations are very different from each other and we do not intend to compare them. In general, the visualizations we have selected are produced by scientific community, so they are of high quality, and as a result, they have mostly received good scores under all criteria of the framework.
