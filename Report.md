# Analysis of data visualization graphs 

### Data Visualization Evaluation Framework
The data visualization effectiveness profile which is used here for the evaluation of five data visualizations selected for the project titled “Climate Change Caused by Human Activity” is shown in Figure 1. This effectiveness profile is based on the evaluation framework designed by Few (2017) who proposed seven distinct criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of data visualizations. Figure 1 shows
these criteria along with a qualitative scoring method designed for each criterion. These seven criteria are broadly categorized into two categories: (1) Informative and (2) Emotive. While the first five criteria, namely, Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness and Intuitiveness lie in the first category and address the degree to which a visualization is informative, the second category includes two criteria, namely, Aesthetics and Engagement that measures useful emotional responses produced by a
visualization (Few, 2017).

Few (2017) also provided guidelines to graphically represent how well a visualization is designed. Although the graphical representation in Few (2017) omitted a quantitative scale for data visualization effectiveness profile, other works from literature related to evaluation frameworks (e.g. Atwood and Reznik-Zellen, 2018) have included a quantitative scale for scoring within each criterion (e.g. 0 to 5-point
scale). I believe that for the type of visualizations selected here, it is more meaningful to evaluate them using a quantitate scale within each criterion. Therefore, for the current project, I have used the effectiveness profile suggested by Few (2017) together with a quantitative 0 to 5-point scale for each criterion. For example, for “Usefulness” criterion a score of zero (0) would imply “Useless visualization” and a score of five (5) would suggest a “very useful visualization”.
